\subsection*{Question 3.4}
The plot of the SVD samples, can be seen in figure \ref{fig:q34}. It can be seen that some of the genes group together, like the MEL gene type at the top of the figure. The gene type BRE can be seen grouping together with all of the other gene types, and is not confined to a small group like the other. This indicates that this gene type might be a misclassification, but it might just the way this gene type is distributed.
