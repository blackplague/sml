\subsection*{Question 2.1}

We calculate the RMS error for the to models, which is displayed in
table \ref{tab:q21} along with the min and max over 50
calculations. In the first model the RMS error is lower than the
other, the first model min and max is also closer. Based on this fact,
we see that the first model is better.

  \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}

    {}		& RMS		& Max		& Min \\
    \hline
    Train1	& 4.4071	& 4.5634	& 4.2075 \\
    \hline
    Test1	& 4.5723	& 5.3269	& 3.9773 \\

    Train2	& 4.8466	& 5.0046	& 4.5746 \\

    Test2	& 4.9268	& 6.0025	& 4.2679 \\
