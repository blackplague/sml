For the shart covariances of the maximum liklighod problem, gives are
liner classifikations, as it can be seen in figur \ref{fig:q24a}. for
the not shart covariances, the classifikation is non liner, ant it
splits op in are split green class, as it can be seen in figur
\ref{fig:q24b}, this cut be are case of overfitting. In comperisen to
the optimal decision regions, figur \ref{fig:q24a} compers best and is
the classifikation model that fits best.
