\subsection*{Question 4.2}

We are to discretize the data into two classes of 'like' and 'dislike'
based on their rating. The following mapping is therefore perform
accoring to table \ref{tab:q42mapping}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c @{$\rightarrow$} c}
1, 2 & 2 \\
4, 5 & 1
\end{tabular}
\caption{Shows mapping to perform discretization.}
\label{tab:q42mapping}
\end{table}

We are now to use a probabilistic classifier to perform classification
and prediction into the two classes and perform a 5-fold cross
validation. I have chosen to use the \textit{mvnpdf} function within
MatLab to model the data distributions, first using indenpendent
covariance and then using shared covariance. Then finally using the
logistic sigmoid to obtain a probability.

Using no threshold $\Theta$ and independent covariance the following
misclassification rates are obtained as seen in table
\ref{tab:q42misctrte}.

\begin{tabular}{r r r}
Set number & Misclassification training & Misclassification test \\
\hline
1    & 27.58413 \% & 27.55433 \% \\
2    & 28.85081 \% & 29.25815 \% \\
