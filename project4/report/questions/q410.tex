\subsection*{Question 4.10}

We are to use the power method for solving the PageRank problem, and
plot the squared difference in the PageRank vector opposed to the true
vector calculated in question 4.9. The number of iterations required
to obtain a squared difference is $42$, this can also be seen from
figure \ref{fig:q410unid_85}. When initializing either the highest
scoring PageRank or lowest scoring convergence is obtained using $50$
iteration which is worse than using the uniform approach. Better
performance would of course be to use numbers from an earlier run, as
these are good initial values for convergence (The same thing Google
does).

    iterations, with $p_i^{(0)} = \frac{1}{N}$ for all $i=1,\ldots,N$,
    using $d = 0.85$}
  \label{fig:q410unid_85}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:q410topd_85} is shown a plot of setting $p_i^{(0)}
= 1$, where $[v \hspace{0.1cm} i] = \max(p)$ and $p_j^{(0)} = 0$ for
all $j \neq i$.

  \label{fig:q410topd_85}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:q410bottomd_85} shows the other way around, where
$p_i^{(0)} = 1$ for the lowest PageRank index.

  \label{fig:q410bottomd_85}
\end{figure}

When setting the highest or lowest ranked entry to 1, the number of
iterations required for convergence is increased in both cases to 50
iterations.

The most important property of the www Google matrix is the fact that
it is very sparse. This makes it possible to store rather 'large'
matrices in memory without using that much memory on it.
